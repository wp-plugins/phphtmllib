This file is just a reminder to myself of the things I know I have yet to do.
It is by no means comprehensive.

3.x
-----
 Start work on a PHP5 specific version of phphtmllib taking advantage
 of the rich set of OOP symantics.
 

2.x.x
-----
- add a function/widget for automatically dumping a db table/schema
  to an xml file.
- Add the display() ability to the base classes to directly output 
  the contents to the output buffer.  This is much better for HUGE pages.
  
- Add a widget repository on the web site.
- build a simple CalendarWidget for showing a nice simple
  calendar with today's date selected
  
- Finish the FormWizard class.
- Add pre_js and post_js methods to the FormProcessor to allow a FormContent and
  FormElement to place JS before and after the <form> tag, instead of the always
  before <form> as it is now
- Add the ability to automatically create a hidden form field in the FormProcessor
  when a FormElement has been disabled.  When a <input> is disabled in the browser,
  the browser never sends it's value when a form is submitted.
  
- Add proper JOIN clause support in the SQLDataListSource to support outer joins.

- Start work on new documentation tutorials to help build a php.net/manual/en style
  of documentation.
  

- Check out the ZZ/OSS php app installer.  Maybe this is a good alternative to 
  the PEAR package installer.  We could use this for 'pluggable' widgets.
