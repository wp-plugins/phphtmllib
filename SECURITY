# DESCRIPTION
#   These are the apache directives to "lock down" phphtmllib after installation in 
#   the web root on your production machine.  This doesn't *have* to happen-- no 
#   critical information will be displayed if it is not done.
#
# USAGE
#   1. rename this file to .htaccess (for this to work AllowOverride All needs to be set some-
#      where in httpd.conf) You can also place these directives in the appropriate directory 
#      block in your httpd.conf file if you have access.
#   2. You can delete these directories:  test, doc, examples.  They are not needed in production.
