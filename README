  -=What is it?=-

   phpHtmllib is a set of PHP classes and library functions to
   help facilitate building, debugging, and rendering of XML,
   HTML, XHTML, WAP/WML Documents, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

   tags, and a programmatic API to generating tags on the fly.

  -------------------

  I would like to personally thank a few good friends of mine
  that have helped me during the development of phpHtmlLib.
  Richard Koreski, HTML guru and Daniel Ceregatti, long time friend.
  Also thanks to my wife Allison for helping me in all the right ways.

  I'd also like to thank the folks at Zend for writing such an excellent engine for PHP.
  PHP is by far the best web language on the planet.

  Oh yah, and thanks Linus!
