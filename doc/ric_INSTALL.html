  phpHtmlLib INSTALLATION


  Introduction
  ============

  I have tried to make the phpHtmlLib fairly easy to install and to use on
  anyone's current running site.  There are a few assumptions I've made, but
  it shouldn't be a problem for 99% of the folks out there.  I haven't tested
  the libs in a Windows environment, as I don't have a M$ O.S.  installed
  anywhere in my house.  If you encounter any issues, please let me know.
  I welcome any and all feedback.
  
  Thanks and enjoy,

  Update
  ======

  The 2.6.0 release introduces several significant changes to phpHtmlLib,
  please read the CHANGELOG for additional details.  The most significant
  change is the elimination of the $phphtmllib global variable which is 
  replaced by two constants (see below).  Several new widgest have been
  added along with new examples.

  The 2.6.0 release of phpHtmlLib has been tested with PHP4.4.x with
  Windows/IIS (5 &amp; 7) as well as RHEL4 Linux and Solaris 2.8 running
  Apache 2.x.

  As of 2.6.0 phpHtmlLib has also been tested with PHP5 running under
  Windows IIS (5 &amp; 7).  All new functionality has been coded with PHP4.

  Questions, comments, concerns, etc. should be raised on the phpHtmlLib
  Community Forums at http://phphtmllib.newsblob.com.

  Installing the libs
  ================================================

  1. Overview for the impatient
     --------------------------

     $ mv phphtmllib &lt;your webdir DOCUMENT_ROOT[/optional/path]&gt;

     Example:

     $ mv phpthmllib /var/www/html/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0
     
     NOTE: As of v2.6.0, the global variable $phphtmllib is no longer
           used.  Instead, use PHPTHMLLIB_ABSPATH and PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH.

     Windows (it is a good idea to escape backslashes on Windows):
         &lt;?php
             define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH&quot;,
                 &quot;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\extlib\\phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
             define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH&quot;, &quot;/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);

             include_once(PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH . &quot;/includes.inc&quot;) ;
         ?&gt;

     Unix/Linux:
         &lt;?php
             define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH&quot;,
                  &quot;/var/www/html/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
             define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH&quot;, &quot;/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);

             include_once(PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH . &quot;/includes.inc&quot;) ;
         ?&gt;

  2. Requirements
     ------------

     The following requirements exist for using phpHtmlLib :

     o  PHP version 4.4.x (should work with 4.2.x)
     o  PHP version 5.2.x
     
     Optional
     o  One of phpHtmlLib's DataListSource Classes can work with
        PEAR and/or ADODB DB abstraction layer classes.  PEAR should
	already be installed if you have a proper PHP install.  You 
	can get ADODB (much better IMHO) from 
	http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB


  3. Installing
     ----------

     1. Copy the entire phphtmllib directory into your website's source
        tree.  The library can be called whatever you like, by default it
        is distributed as &quot;phphtmllib&quot;.  You don't have to have it installed
        in the document root, but that is where I normally install it.
	
     2. As of v2.6.0, the global variable $phphtmllib is no longer
           used.  Instead, use PHPTHMLLIB_ABSPATH and PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH.
           You must define these two constants at the beginning of your
           PHP file(s) before you reference the phpHtmlLib include files.

        After that you should be able to include the main includes file
	  include_once(PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH . &quot;/includes.inc&quot;); to include
          all of the files in the lib, or you can include each file that
          you need individually to save include processing.

        Windows (it is a good idea to escape backslashes on Windows):
            &lt;?php
                define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH&quot;,
                    &quot;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\extlib\\phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
                define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH&quot;, &quot;/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);

                include_once(PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH . &quot;/includes.inc&quot;) ;
            ?&gt;

        Unix/Linux:
            &lt;?php
                define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH&quot;,
                     &quot;/var/www/html/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
                define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH&quot;, &quot;/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);

                include_once(PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH . &quot;/includes.inc&quot;) ;
            ?&gt;

     3. Optionally, review the SECURITY file if you are installing 
        phphtmllib into a production environment.
