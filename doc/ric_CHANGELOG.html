$Id: ric_CHANGELOG.html 3543 2011-01-28 14:07:31Z mpwalsh8 $

++ Major change or new feature.
+  fairly large change
-  minor change

version 2.6.0
++  Introduction of PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH and PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH constants
    which replace the global variable $phphtmllib.  Introduction of these
    constants removes the requirement that phpHtmlLib reside in the web
    server root directory and be called &quot;phphtmllib&quot;.  It can now reside
    anywhere within the web site's directory structure and can be called
    any name (e.g. /includes/phphtmllib_2.6.0).
++  Obsoleted $phphtmllib global variable.  This variable is no longer used
    anywhere within phpHtmlLib.  It has been replaced with two constants,
    PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH and PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH.
++  PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH constant - must be defined as the absolute file
    system path where phpHtmlLib is installed.
    Windows (it is a good idea to escape backslashes on Windows):
    define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH&quot;, &quot;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\extlib\\phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
    Linix/Unix:
    define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH&quot;, &quot;/var/www/html/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
++  PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH constant - mussst defined as the relative location,
    with respect to the web site root directory, where phpHtmlLib is installed.
    define(&quot;PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH&quot;, &quot;/extlib/phphtmllib_2.6.0&quot;);
 +  New include file phpHtmlLib.inc which can be referenced to automatically
    set PHPHTMLLIB_ABSPATH and PHPHTMLLIB_RELPATH.  This include file can
    determine where it resides and set the constants appropriately.  It is 
    used by the examples to ensure they all work properly regardless of where
    phpHtmlLib is installed but explicit constant assignment is prefered for
    actual application development.
 +  BBCodeTextArea - new widget for the collection and processing of BBCode
    formatted text.
 +  CalendarTable - new widget for dislaying calendars.
 +  New examples for BBCodeTextArea and CalendarTable widgets.
 -  Clean up of examples to ensure they work under Windows/IIS.
 -  New FEComboListBoxVertical widget which extends the FEComboListBox
    widget but displays the from/to boxes vertically instead of horizontally.
 -  Changes to DefaultGUIDataList navigation to allow phpHtmlLib to work as
    a component of a WordPress plugin.

    to resolve a conflict with the FERadioGroup text links
  - changed FECheckBox clickable text to use the same css class name as the
    FERadioGroup clickable text.  'form_link'
  + Added a new optional parameter to the FormElement::get_element_name()
    so it can be called statically to discover an element's name that is used
    in the form, based on a string.
  + First pass at a working FormWizard.  It's still combersome a bit.
  + Added an index parameter to FormElement::build_id_name() for building

    the search box strings.

 ++ Added FormElement::set_readonly(), which is used by the FormContent
    class to show the get_value_text() version of an element instead of
    the get_element().  This creates a simple way to do viewable only forms.
  - changed the FormContent::build_confirm_table() to always use get_value_text()
    since get_value_text() should always return the human readable string of
    the value of the FormElement.
  + Added the id attribute for all hidden form elements created in the FormContent
  - fixed potential issue with FEEmailMany validation with whitespaces
  + Got the DefaultGUIDataList properly showing the no data found message when
    no data was found from the DatListSource

    1 through 9.  The labels are unchanged.

    (thanks Pierre)
  - fixed some warnings in the DefaultGUIDataList object.
  + Added a DataList::do_action() method that allows you to do whatever

Version 2.2.4 - April 3, 2003

    method.

    D'oh.

  - fixed a problem with the FormContent errors table width.
  - fixed an error in the form1 example.

    FECheckBox Form Element.

    a BaseWidget child class.  It doesn't have a _tag member, so
    folks that have MAX errors on, got a warning.
  - Fixed a potential issue with XML attributes.  There was a chance
    that an XML tag's attribute could be empty, which would build
    an invalid XML tag.  DOCTYPE is now an HTMLTagClass child, because
    it needs attributes w/o values.
  - Changed FormProcessor to use &quot;post&quot; instead of &quot;POST&quot; so that we
    build valid XHTML

    all lowercase, to build valid XHTML.
  - added HTMLPageClass::add_js_link() to replace push_js_link()

    with a input type=&quot;image&quot;.  bogus.
  + Added the ability to override the FormValidation and FormErrors classes
    used by the FormProcessor, so folks can get their errors and text from
    any method.  This helps folks create their own i18n FormErrors class.

Version 2.2.2 - March 10, 2003
  - Aris Basic &lt;aris.basic at silencesoftware.com&gt; added a new
    PGSQLDataListSource object, to allow folks to use the
    PHP built in PostgreSQL native functions for talking to
    a DB.  This avoids the depenancy on PEAR or ADODB.
  - Added the xhtml_strict_attributes array to the FORMtag
    declaration.  the attributes 'name' and 'target' are not

    automatically drops the close tag.
  - fixed a problem with HTML tags with no content.  it no longer
    renders a newline after the open tag.
  - fixed a the DOCTYPE tag attributes for XHTML mode.  It now gives
    the full url path to the DTD's on the W3C site.
    (thanks to Philipp Morger &lt;morger at dolphins.ch&gt; )
  - fixed a small indenting problem with XMLTagClass::render_content()

    the attributes are for the select tag.
  + Added the new RoundTitleTable widget.  It looks like the
    NavTable widget, but can contain anything.
  - fixed a minor issue with Container::reset_content()  It used to
    accept new content to automagically add.  This has been re-added.
    Thanks to Freddy from Germany. :)
  - fixed another duplicated method in SQLDataListSource.  arg.
  + Added the CSSContainer widget
  + changed all of the themed css building scripts to use the
    new CSSContainer widget.  This is handy for site wide
    themeing.

  - Added the ability to set the overall alignment for the
    DefaultGUIDataList object with set_align()
  - added some code to the ActiveTab to enable going to a

    XMLTagClass and HTMLTagClass.  I nuked ALL of the flag variables
    and made them all into 1 bitmask.  13 variables -&gt; 1.  This should
    keep the memory footprint to a minimum.  There should be NO
    compatibility issues.

    forms and automagic validation, as well as automagic confirmation.

Version 2.1.3 - November 25, 2002
  - fixed a duplicated method in ActiveTab.

Version 2.1.2 - November 23, 2002
  - fixed a problem with html_map(), it was returning a LEGENDtag.
  - added $width to ActiveTab::add_tab() so you can change the width
    of the tab for long titles.
  - Fixed my mistake with the add/push_reference() methods.
    According to the php spec, you have to declare the parameter
    as a reference in the function declaration now, which is
    counter-intuitive (for us C folks)
  - Fixed a problem with the XMLDocumentClass' add_reference() method.

Version 2.1.1 - November 12, 2002
  - Suren Fixed a bad bug in HTMLPageClass::add_head_content()


Version 2.1.0 - November 12, 2002

  - added form_active_radio() and form_active_checkbox()
  + Did some major code cleanup in the _render_tag_* functions
    between the XMLTagClass and the HTMLTagClass classes.  Just had
    some legacy code living in the HTMLTagClass methods that was
    now living in the XMLTagClass methods
  - changed DOCTYPEtag to an XMLTag child
  - cleaned up the constructor for the DOCTYPEtag and XMLtag
  + Did some minor tweaks here and there in the base classes
    for performance improvements thanks to the adp profiler tool
    (http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=118)
  + Added xml_doctype() as a helper function for creating a
    DOCTYPE tag
  + added build_doctype() for the HTMLPageClass, so you can modify
    the DOCTYPE attributes for the document before render() is called.
    This is good for folks that want to tweak the link1 and link2
    attributes to put mozilla/IE into standards compliant mode.

     http://mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/quirks/doctypes.html
     http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/doctype.asp

    coming from 2 different sources.  One source is a PEAR DB object, the
    2nd source is from an ADODB DB Object.
  + Added a CSVFILEDataListSource object, to read data from a CSV formatted file.
  - Added the CDATAtag, which is used for escaping a tag's contents in XML, so
    the xml parser reading the xml doesn't parse the data.
  + added the full set of W3C's 1.0 recommendation of SVG (Scalable Vector
    Graphics) tags.
  + Added the svg_utils.inc which contains the helper functions for constructing
    commonly used SVG tags with some help from Charlie Killian.

  - Added the new DataList object widget set.

Version 2.0.0-RC1 - October 2,2002
  MAJOR CHANGES/FEATURES
  - Completely rewrote the base HTMLTagClass.  It is now
    based off of XMLTagClass which is a child of the
    Container class (formerly known as ContainerWidget )

  - Changed all push_reference() calls to require a reference to
    be passed in.  call time pass by reference is depricated, and
    is going away soon, so this had to get changed.

  - Removed 2nd and 3rd parameter declarations from the
    HTMLTagClass constructor.  It now accepts any number
    of arguments.  The first argument is always an array
    of the tag attributes.

  - Added a lot of missing html_* helper/wrapper functions.
    Some of which have special parameters for most commonly
    used features of the specific tag.

  - changed html_td() parameters.  It now accepts
    function html_td($class=&quot;&quot;, $align=&quot;&quot;).  3rd param to
    n is content for the tag.

  - added class as the first param to the html_div() function.

  - Added add() and add_reference() calls.  These replace
    the old style push() and push_reference() calls.
    All push(), push_reference() and push_row() calls are
    depricated.

  - Completely changed the css functionality in the widgets.
    The widgets now contain the css required for the widget

  - HTMLPageClass automatically imports javascript and css
    from a widget, if it is based off of the BaseWidget class

  - Added the ability to tell the PageWidget and HTMLPageClass
    the style of indenting of the html output you want.
    Nice or left justified.


 MINOR CHANGES/FEATURES
  - changed all tag declarations to lower case.  HTML 4.01
    spec recommends using lower case tags.
  - Added set_class(), set_style() and set_id() for the HTMLTagClass.
  - Added 1st param to html_span() to be the class value.
  - added some new functionality to form_select() so it can
    handle multiple selection boxes.
  - Added a bunch of missing html/xhtml tags.
  - Added some new params to html_mailto() to support
    subject, body, cc
  - fixed newline problem with the META tag
  - added html_small() (Suren Markossian)
  - Added set_collapse() to let you collapse a tag and it's
    content on 1 line (no newlines or indenting)
  - Added html_* functions for all the supported Tag Classes.
  - removed the html_nobr(), since this really isn't a valid
    w3c tag. If you HAVE to use it...don't.  It's DEPRICATED.
  - removed SPACERtag.  its not a real tag.
  - cleaned out almost all the comments in the ALLTAGS.inc file
    for a small speed up.
  - Added font_utils.inc which holds various span/div tag
    objects with css classes for fonts, which are defeined in
    css/fonts.css
  - Added title parameter to the NavTable widget-&gt;add(), and made
    the target param last.
  - Moved the widget css files to /css




Version 1.1.0 - May 7, 2002
  - Removed &lt;&gt; symbols from the $_tag variables since it is not a part
    of an HTML tag. This should reduce the usage of str_replace() in
    render() functions and make things a little bit faster.
  - Added html_div_small(), which can be used instead of the
    spacer.gif trick.
  - Fixed a bug with form_radio().  Thanks (Tim Moloney)
  - Added container(), a ContainerWidget helper function.
  - Fixed a w3c validation bug with the &lt;HR&gt; tag.  Can't
    have a close tag for it.  Thanks (James Dingwall)
  - Fixed a problem with XHTML_STRICT no rendering the
    &lt;!doctype&gt; attributes correctly. Thanks (Ricardo Pardini)
  - Added HTMLPageClass::get_html_attributes() and
    HTMLPageClass::set_html_attributes(), which lets the user
    of the class get/set the specific attributes to use
    for the &lt;html&gt; tag.

    NOTE:
  - Moved all files from .php to .inc. make sure you change
    you includes to reflect this change.


Version 1.0.3 - April 8, 2002
  - Fixed a potential formatting issue w/ tags that don't
    automatically newline after the opentag.  thanks to the
    Zend debugger.
  - Added misc_utils.php which holds new push_args() function.
  - set newline_after_opentag for OPTIONtag to FALSE by default.
  - Added target to NavTable::push();
  - Changed InfoTable's css to a php file, so we can dynamically
    change the colors.
  - Made the default cellspacing 0 for InfoTable.
  - Fixed a small problem with NavTable widget.  If there was no
    subtitle, it would render an empty table for the title,
    causing old Mozilla's to puke.
  - Changed the size of the TextNav text to 10pt instead of 8pt.
  - Added FRAMEtag, FRAMESETtag, NOFRAMEStag classes.
  - Added support in HTMLPageClass widget for framesets.
  - Added some frame* utility functions.
  - Combined all of the tag_classes files into 1 file to avoid
    lots of repetetive includes.
  - Added the new ContainerWidget, which is nothing but a
    wrapper object that contains tags/widgets, and knows how to
    render the content with the appropriate indentation level.
  - added the feature of automatically trying to collapse a
    tag and its content to 1 line.  This happens if a tag
    only has 1 content entry and its a string w/o a \n in it.
  - Added new html_input() wrapper function which automatically
    will call htmlspecialchars() on the data for the value
    attribute.  This helps prevent problems with
    &lt;input value=&quot;foo&quot;&quot;&gt;   -&gt; &lt;input value=&quot;foo&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;
  - Fixed a problem with the form_select() helper function.
    The selected item wasn't working.
  - Added container(), which is a helper function to build
    a ContainerWidget and populate it.



Version 1.0.2 - November 30,2001
  - added 3rd parameter to the HTMLTagClass constructor.  It
    accepts the $newline_after_opentag setting.  This helps
    to keep the nice formatting on certain tags that you want
    to override the default behaviour.

  - fixed HTMLPageClass character encoding bug.  It wasn't
    outputing a proper meta tag.
  - changed doctype for 4.0 to 4.01
  - added target param for the html_a() helper function.
  - changed the default parameters to html_img_href, and
    html_img.  We were forcing the width and height of an image
    to 1x1 if nothing was passed in.  We now don't add them to
    the tags if they aren't set, which is the desired result.

  - Changed the FooterNav class to add the ability to show a
    &quot;webmaster&quot; mailto link.  I also cleaned up the formatting
    of it a bit as well.

  - fixed source formatting issue with html_img_href()
  - changed html_a() to always force no newline after opentag
  - added $target to html_img_href()
  - added html_th() helper function.
  - Changed html_textarea.  Added a new parameter of Value
    so you can prepopulate the text area field with data.
  - Fixed a bug with InfoTable's render() method.  It wasn't
    properly handling the output_debug param.
  - Added TODO file.
  - Added a new feature to automatically htmlentities() for
    tag attribute values if we are rendering in XHTML_STRICT
    mode.  This prevents the w3c validator from complaining
    about the &amp; char.


Version 1.0.1 - August 25, 2001
  - added html_div(), and html_td()
  - added html_div(), and html_td()
  - fixed w3c validation bug for the TextNav class.
    We can't put a background image in a td.  It Has
    to be in a css.
  - Fixed a &lt;TD colspan&gt; issue for a blank entry in the
    NavTable class.
  - reorganized html_utils.php so the functions are in
    alphabetical order.  Should be easier to find them
    as a reference.
  - added usemap attribute support to html_img() and
    html_img_href()
  - updated the online API docs (javadoc output) in the
    doc directory.
